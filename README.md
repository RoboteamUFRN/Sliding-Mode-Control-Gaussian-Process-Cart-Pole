In this project you can find the:
(a) codes used for implementating the proposed controller for a cart-pole system;
(b) and all the results obtained by this implementation considering the proposed and conventional approaches.

The columns of the results, results_smc, results_track, and results_smc_track files are divided as follows:
[1] time
[2] x position
[3] x desired position
[4] angular position	
[5] angular desired position
[6] control action
[7] sliding variable
[8] desired output for the GP distribution
[9] mean of the GP distribution
[10] variance of the GP distribution
